         "description": "The Pseudo Two-Dimensional (P2D) model was introduced by Newman et al. and describes the behaviour of a porous electrode battery. It is a one dimensional model, but assumes that at each point of the electrode there is a spherical particle that represents the active material. Therefore, the model has a second dimension in the ratial direction.",
